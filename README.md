# math_cheatsheet

This is a collection of formulas, definitions, and other math stuff I
have had to look up, find out, struggle with, and decided to write
down for the future refence.

Feel free to use and copy the formulas here.  But be careful -- there
is probably a number of errors and misunderstandings!

The cheatsheet started around 1999 when I studied economics at Tartu
University and wrote a sheet (yes, a single sheet ;-) of formulas to help
my coursemates with math.  There are still many pieces of text from that
time, in particlar those related to limits and Taylor's
approximation.  The pages filled with Tobit and duration models'
Hessians are leftovers from my Master and PhD thesis.  I wrote it in Estonian back then, and I don't intend
to translate it just for translation's sake.  Only if I am rewriting
an old piece of text I'll do it in English.

Have fun!
